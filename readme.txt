This plugin is designed to be as simple to use as possible. The only configuration required is adding your API and Studio URL.

You can then add maps to your pages and posts using the "Add MapFig Map" button.

If you want to compare the free and supported versios side by side then you didn't read above :)  

Plugin features are identical. Supported versions just gives you direct ticket support.

You **can** also opt to add GPX, SVG, and Playback at no additional charge.

The reason that GPX, SVG, and Playback are offered separately as for 99% of WordPress users they would not be used and would just add complexity to the plugin.
